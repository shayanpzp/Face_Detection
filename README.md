# Face Detection with OpenCV

This Python project demonstrates face detection using OpenCV, a powerful computer vision library. It's a simple yet effective implementation for detecting faces in images.

## Features

- Utilizes the Haar Cascade Classifier for frontal face detection.
- Easy to understand code for beginners in computer vision.
- Adjustable parameters like scale factor and minimum neighbors for fine-tuning.
- Resizes the output image for better visualization.

## Usage

1. Clone the repository or download the code.
2. Place the image you want to analyze in the same directory.
3. Run the Python script, and it will display the image with detected faces.


## Dependencies

- Python 
- OpenCV library
